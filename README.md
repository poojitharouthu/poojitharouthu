Hi, I’m Poojitha — a CSE student who loves clean UI, simple projects, and learning something new every day.
I enjoy building small web apps, experimenting with frontend design, and writing neat, readable code.

What I’m Working On:
1. Building more mini–projects to strengthen Python + frontend skills
2. Learning Flask, JavaScript, and UI/UX fundamentals
3. Exploring clean and minimal design patterns

Tech I Use:
1. Python, Flask
2. HTML & CSS
3. Git & GitHub
4. UI Design (Figma / Canva)

Featured Project:
Expense Tracker — a clean and minimal Flask-based tracker with a custom UI layout
